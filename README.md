# LiDAR_3d_vis_with_r
This repository presents the data and source code for an Internship projected conducted in 2021 with the Geospatial Research Institute in Christchurch, New Zealand. This project was undertaken as part of the Professional Master of Geospatial Science and Technology program coursework at the University of Canterbury for a 3 month attachment with industries to train and perform research or project work.

The project task was to automate the extraction and visualisation of airborne LiDAR point clouds into 3D parametric surfaces. This was exploratory in nature and a small subset of the point clouds over the university area was used. Coding was performed usin the R computing language.
# Installation
To replicate this work, clone this repository into your local machine. Also, LiDAR data needs to be downloaded from open topography and placed in teh project folder before running the code.
